Each chapter will be broken down into sections that will outline the decision making and available evidence used to provide each presented risk prediction. This risk calculator is developed for the sole purpose of decision support and resuls should not superscede clinician and patient preference. 1.2 Methods The initial algorithms included in this project were found through a literature search of available medical databases, bibliography reviews and referrals from content experts. Published algorithms were reviewed and included if they met the following inclusion criteria. Input variables available and commonly collected in the pre-operative setting. Outcome variable relevant to clinician and patient for decision making. Full regression model with beta coefficients and intercept publicly available in publication or through contact with publication authors. Available risk models were then reviewed and included based on their quality. Quality of risk model was determined according to published TRIPOD guidelines,1 prioritizing the following values: Accuracy assessments, such as AUC, sensitivity or specificity assessments determined through internal and external validation. Parsimonious input variable selection and clear description of variable definitions and manipulations. Clearly described homogeneous patient population that aligns with the clinical question. Transparent stakeholder engagement and algorithm development. 1.3 Feedback For suggestions, comments or questions please submit an issue on our github page or send us an email.
