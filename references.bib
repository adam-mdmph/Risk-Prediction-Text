  abstract = {Prediction models are developed to aid health care providers in estimating the probability or risk that a specific disease or condition is present (diagnostic models) or that a specific event will occur in the future (prognostic models), to inform their decision making. However, the overwhelming evidence shows that the quality of reporting of prediction model studies is poor. Only with full and clear reporting of information on all aspects of a prediction model can risk of bias and potential usefulness of prediction models be adequately assessed. The Transparent Reporting of a multivariable prediction model for Individual Prognosis Or Diagnosis (TRIPOD) Initiative developed a set of recommendations for the reporting of studies developing, validating, or updating a prediction model, whether for diagnostic or prognostic purposes. This article describes how the TRIPOD Statement was developed. An extensive list of items based on a review of the literature was created, which was reduced after a Web-based survey and revised during a 3-day meeting in June 2011 with methodologists, health care professionals, and journal editors. The list was refined during several meetings of the steering group and in e-mail discussions with the wider group of TRIPOD contributors. The resulting TRIPOD Statement is a checklist of 22 items, deemed essential for transparent reporting of a prediction model study. The TRIPOD Statement aims to improve the transparency of the reporting of a prediction model study regardless of the study methods used. The TRIPOD Statement is best used in conjunction with the TRIPOD explanation and elaboration document. To aid the editorial process and readers of prediction model studies, it is recommended that authors include a completed checklist in their submission (also available at www.tripod-statement.org).

  abstract = {Objective: To develop accurate preoperative risk prediction models for multiple adverse postoperative outcomes applicable to a broad surgical population using a parsimonious common set of risk variables and outcomes. Summary Background Data: Currently, preoperative assessment of surgical risk is largely based on subjective clinician experience. We propose a paradigm shift from the current postoperative risk adjustment for crosshospital comparison to patient-centered quantitative risk assessment during the preoperative evaluation. Methods: We identify the most common and important predictor variables of postoperative mortality, overall morbidity, and 6 complication clusters from previously published prediction analyses that used forward selection stepwise logistic regression. We then refit the prediction models using only the 8 most common and important predictor variables, and compare the discrimination and calibration of these models to the original full-variable models using the c-index, Hosmer-Lemeshow analysis, and Brier scores. Results: Accurate risk models for 30-day outcomes of mortality, overall morbidity, and 6 clusters of complications were developed using a set of 8 preoperative risk variables. C-indexes of the 8 variable models are between 97.9\% and 99.2\% of those of the full models containing up to 28 variables, indicating excellent discrimination using fewer predictor variables. HosmerLemeshow analyses showed observed to expected event rates to be nearly identical between parsimonious models and full models, both showing good calibration. Conclusions: Accurate preoperative risk assessment of postoperative mortality, overall morbidity, and 6 complication clusters in a broad surgical population can be achieved with as few as 8 preoperative predictor variables, improving feasibility of routine preoperative risk assessment for surgical patients.},

  abstract = {Objective: To use factor analysis to cluster the 18 American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS NSQIP) perioperative complications into a reproducible, smaller number of clinically meaningful groups of postoperative complications, facilitating and streamlining future study and application in live clinical settings. Background: The ACS NSQIP collects and reports on eighteen 30-day postoperative complications (excluding mortality), which are variably grouped in published analyses using ACS NSQIP data. This hinders comparison between studies of this widely used quality improvement dataset. Methods: Factor analysis was used to develop a series of complication clusters, which were then analyzed to identify a parsimonious, clinically meaningful grouping, using 2,275,240 surgical cases in the ACS NSQIP Participant Use File (PUF), 2005 to 2012. The main outcome measures are reproducible, data-driven, clinically meaningful clusters of complications derived from factor solutions. Results: Factor analysis solutions for 5 to 9 latent factors were examined for their percent of total variance, parsimony, and clinical interpretability. Applying the first 2 of these criteria, we identified the 7-factor solution, which included clusters of pulmonary, infectious, wound disruption, cardiac/ transfusion, venous thromboembolic, renal, and neurological complications, as the best solution for parsimony and clinical meaningfulness. Applying the last (clinical interpretability), we combined the wound disruption with the infectious clusters resulting in 6 clusters for future clinical applications. Conclusions: Factor analysis of ACS NSQIP postoperative complication data provides 6 clinically meaningful complication clusters in lieu of 18},

  abstract = {Objective The objective of this study was to develop and to validate the Vascular Quality Initiative (VQI) Cardiac Risk Index (CRI) for prediction of postoperative myocardial infarction (POMI) after vascular surgery. Methods We developed risk models for in-hospital POMI after 88,791 nonemergent operations from the VQI registry, including carotid endarterectomy (CEA; n = 45,340), infrainguinal bypass (INFRA; n = 18,054), suprainguinal bypass (SUPRA; n = 2678), endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR; n = 18,539), and open abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (OAAA repair; n = 4180). Multivariable logistic regression was used to create an all-procedure and four procedure-specific risk calculators based on the derivation cohort from 2012 to 2014 (N = 61,236). Generalizability of the all-procedure model was evaluated by applying it to each procedure subtype. The models were validated using a cohort (N = 27,555) from January 2015 to February 2016. Model discrimination was measured by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), and performance was validated by bootstrapping 5000 iterations. The VQI CRI calculator was made available on the Internet and as a free smart phone app available through QxCalculate. Results Overall POMI incidence was 1.6\%, with variation by procedure type as follows: CEA, 0.8\%; EVAR, 1.0\%; INFRA, 2.6\%; SUPRA, 3.1\%; and OAAA repair, 4.3\% (P {$<$} .001). Predictors of POMI in the all-procedure model included age, operation type, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, diabetes, creatinine concentration {$>$}1.8 mg/dL, stress test status, and body mass index (AUC, 0.75; 95\% confidence interval =CI], 0.73-0.76). The all-procedure model demonstrated only minimally reduced accuracy when it was applied to each procedure, with the following AUCs: CEA, 0.65 (95\% CI, 0.59-0.70); INFRA, 0.69 (95\% CI, 0.64-0.73); EVAR, 0.72 (95\% CI, 0.65-0.80); SUPRA, 0.62 (95\% CI, 0.52-0.72); and OAAA, 0.63 (95\% CI, 0.56-0.70). Procedure-specific models had unique predictors and showed improved prediction compared with the all-procedure model, with the following AUCs: CEA, 0.69 (95\% CI, 0.66-0.72); INFRA, 0.75 (95\% CI, 0.73-0.78); EVAR, 0.76 (95\% CI, 0.73-0.80); and OAAA, 0.72 (95\% CI, 0.69-0.77). Bias-corrected AUC (95\% CI) from internal validation for the models was as follows: all procedures, 0.75 (0.73-0.76); CEA, 0.68 (0.65-0.71); INFRA, 0.74 (0.72-0.76); EVAR, 0.73 (0.70-0.78); and OAAA repair, 0.68 (0.65-0.73). Conclusions The VQI CRI is a useful and valid clinical decision-making tool to predict POMI after vascular surgery. Procedure-specific models improve accuracy when they include unique risk factors.},

  abstract = {Background\textemdash Perioperative myocardial infarction or cardiac arrest is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The Revised Cardiac Risk Index is currently the most commonly used cardiac risk stratification tool; however, it has several limitations, one of which is its relatively low discriminative ability. The objective of the present study was to develop and validate a predictive cardiac risk calculator. Methods and Results\textemdash Patients who underwent surgery were identified from the American College of Surgeons' 2007 National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database, a multicenter (Ͼ250 hospitals) prospective database. Of the 211 410 patients, 1371 (0.65\%) developed perioperative myocardial infarction or cardiac arrest. On multivariate logistic regression analysis, 5 predictors of perioperative myocardial infarction or cardiac arrest were identified: type of surgery, dependent functional status, abnormal creatinine, American Society of Anesthesiologists' class, and increasing age. The risk model based on the 2007 data set was subsequently validated on the 2008 data set (nϭ257 385). The model performance was very similar between the 2007 and 2008 data sets, with C statistics (also known as area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) of 0.884 and 0.874, respectively. Application of the Revised Cardiac Risk Index to the 2008 National Surgical Quality Improvement Program data set yielded a relatively lower C statistic (0.747). The risk model was used to develop an interactive risk calculator. Conclusions\textemdash The cardiac risk calculator provides a risk estimate of perioperative myocardial infarction or cardiac arrest and is anticipated to simplify the informed consent process. Its predictive performance surpasses that of the Revised Cardiac Risk Index. (Circulation. 2011;124:381-387.)},

  abstract = {Objective: The Revised Cardiac Risk Index (RCRI) is a widely used model for predicting cardiac events after noncardiac surgery. We compared the accuracy of the RCRI with a new, vascular surgery-specific model developed from patients within the Vascular Study Group of New England (VSGNE). Methods: We studied 10,081 patients who underwent nonemergent carotid endarterectomy (CEA; n ؍ 5293), lower extremity bypass (LEB; n ؍ 2673), endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR; n ؍ 1005), and open infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (OAAA; n ؍ 1,110) within the VSGNE from 2003 to 2008. First, we analyzed the ability of the RCRI to predict in-hospital major adverse cardiac events, including myocardial infarction (MI), arrhythmia, or congestive heart failure (CHF) in the VSGNE cohort. Second, we used a derivation cohort of 8208 to develop a new cardiac risk prediction model specifically for vascular surgery patients. Chi-square analysis identified univariate predictors, and multivariate logistic regression was used to develop an aggregate and four procedure-specific risk prediction models for cardiac complications. Calibration and model discrimination were assessed using Pearson correlation coefficient and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. The ability of the model to predict cardiac complications was assessed within a validation cohort of 1873. Significant predictors were converted to an integer score to create a practical cardiac risk prediction formula. Results: The overall incidence of major cardiac events in the VSGNE cohort was 6.3\% (2.5\% MI, 3.9\% arrhythmia, 1.8\% CHF). The RCRI predicted risk after CEA reasonably well but substantially underestimated risk after LEB, EVAR, and OAAA for low- and higher-risk patients. Across all VSGNE patients, the RCRI underestimated cardiac complications by 1.7- to 7.4-fold based on actual event rates of 2.6\%, 6.7\%, 11.6\%, and 18.4\% for patients with 0, 1, 2, and {$>$}3 risk factors. In multivariate analysis of the VSGNE cohort, independent predictors of adverse cardiac events were (odds ratio [OR]) increasing age (1.7-2.8), smoking (1.3), insulin-dependent diabetes (1.4), coronary artery disease (1.4), CHF (1.9), abnormal cardiac stress test (1.2), long-term NL-blocker therapy (1.4), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (1.6), and creatinine {$>$}1.8 mg/dL (1.7). Prior cardiac revascularization was protective (OR, 0.8). Our aggregate model was well calibrated (r ؍ 0.99, P {$<$} .001), demonstrating moderate discriminative ability (ROC curve ؍ 0.71), which differed only slightly from the procedure-specific models (ROC curves: CEA, 0.74; LEB, 0.72; EVAR, 0.74; OAAA, 0.68). Rates of cardiac complications for patients with 0 to 3, 4, 5, and {$>$}6 VSG risk factors were 3.1\%, 5.0\%, 6.8\%, and 11.6\% in the derivation cohort and 3.8\%, 5.2\%, 8.1\%, and 10.1\% in the validation cohort. The VSGNE cardiac risk model more accurately predicted the actual risk of cardiac complications across the four procedures for low- and higher-risk patients than the RCRI. When the VSG Cardiac Risk Index (VSG-CRI) was used to score patients, six categories of risk ranging from 2.6\% to 14.3\% (score of 0-3 to 8) were discernible. Conclusions: The RCRI substantially underestimates in-hospital cardiac events in patients undergoing elective or urgent vascular surgery, especially after LEB, EVAR, and OAAA. The VSG-CRI more accurately predicts in-hospital cardiac events after vascular surgery and represents an important tool for clinical decision making. ( J Vasc Surg 2010;52:674-83.)},
